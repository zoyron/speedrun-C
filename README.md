## What does a compiler actually do?

A compiler carries out the following steps

- **Pre-processing**: Pre-processing converts all of those "hash include - #include" lines to the respective prototypes that are inside those include files

- **Compiling**: After the pre-processing step has happened, the code then gets converted to the assembly language during this `compiling` step.

- **Assembling**: This steps takes the assembly code and then converts it to the 0s and 1s.
